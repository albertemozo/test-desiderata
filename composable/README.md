# Composable

We present a simple class with two alternative test suites.

The combinatorial tests are checking each possible mix of inputs.

The composable tests focus on each business rule separately.

Run both suites with coverage.

Both pass, both cover the same code, but one is much more expressive and easy to maintain.
