# Specific

We present two testing approaches.

Both cover 100% of the code, but they differ on specificity.

One is broader, with just a couple of cases to cover all the code.

The other is more specific, with more cases to cover each business rule.

Run the two tests with coverage to check they are equivalent.

Now change a business rule, for example the weekend extra time.

In which case is it easier to track down the cause of the error?
